		<p class="content-description">You have an Essay deadline at midnight, but you want to play Mage Hunter! Convince yourself in a card game battle with dopamine, psychology and excuses that you will find while slaying mages. But remember, the deadline is inevitable...</p>
		<p class="content-description">This game was made in 72 hours for a game jam with the theme 'Delay the inevitable'. At this time I barely had any prior experience in game development and I thought it would be a nice way to challenge myself and learn something new!</p>
		<p class="content-description">The game was made using Unity and C#. I also created all assets for the game except audio. While I might not be the most artistically skilled, I do enjoy to be creative!</p>
